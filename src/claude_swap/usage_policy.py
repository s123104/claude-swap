"""Usage-window parsing and switch-target ranking for claude-swap.

Single source of truth for every "which account should we be on?" decision —
the manual ``--strategy best`` switch and the automated planner behind the
monitor both route through here, so the two ranking modes (stay-biased
``headroom_best``, always-ranking ``cooldown_aware``) differ on purpose
rather than by accident. No I/O of its own and no ``switcher`` import;
callers inject the sequence data and switchability checks they own.
