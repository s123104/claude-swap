"""OAuth credential-freshness layer for claude-swap.

Owns read-modify-write paths that keep backup OAuth tokens fresh and verified
— refresh before activation, sync Claude-Code-rotated tokens back to backup,
verify a write matches the live store. Split out of ``switcher.py`` so the
switcher reads as account orchestration again.

``CredentialRefresher`` is a leaf collaborator: it depends on ``RefreshHost``
for credential primitives (``_read_credentials``, ``_read_account_credentials``,
``_write_account_credentials``) and ``lock_file`` / ``_live_session_pids`` /
``_logger``, but never owns storage routing — that stays in ``CredentialStore``.

        On macOS in particular, the live Claude credential can lag or be
        concurrently mutated around login/switch boundaries. Writing a backup
        without read-back verification can silently preserve stale tokens.
        Returns the credential string actually persisted to backup.

        Two distinct drift modes are disambiguated:

        1. **Our write didn't take** (e.g. Keychain ACL hiccup): ``stored``
           never matches ``expected`` even when ``live_now`` is stable. After
           ``_BACKUP_CREDENTIAL_VERIFY_ATTEMPTS`` tries we raise
           ``CredentialWriteError`` — this is a genuine storage failure.

        2. **Claude Code is rotating tokens under us** during the verification
           window (its own refresh fired concurrently): ``live_now`` keeps
           changing across attempts. Looping forever is pointless; on the
           final attempt we log a warning and persist whatever ``live_now``
           sampled last. Backup is at most one rotation stale, which the
           normal refresh-before-activation path resolves on the next switch.

        When ``assume_locked`` is True, the caller already holds
        ``FileLock(self._sw.lock_file)`` and this method runs the verification
        loop without acquiring again. ``FileLock`` is not re-entrant — callers
        inside an existing lock (e.g. ``sync_live_to_backup``) must pass
        ``assume_locked=True``.

        When ``assume_locked`` is False (default), this method acquires the
        lock itself, blocking until it is available.
