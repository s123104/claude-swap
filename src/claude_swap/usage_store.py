"""Per-account usage table: last-known-good measurements + fetch/backoff state.

Replaces the all-or-nothing 15s snapshot that previously lived in
``cache/usage.json`` (now ``schemaVersion: 2``; a version-less legacy file is
treated as empty — its data had a 15s shelf life anyway). One failed round
trip no longer blanks every account: a failure updates the error/backoff
fields and never touches the last-good measurement (stale-on-error). The
table is shared by ``--list``/``--status`` (on-demand refresh of stale
entries) and ``cswap auto`` (scheduled polling), so each learns from the
other's fetches.

The store persists only *measurements* (``lastGood``) and *fetch state*
(failures, backoff, poll schedule). Sentinel states ("api key",
"token expired", ...) are derived fresh by the collector on every pass and
overlaid on the read model (``UsageEntry.sentinel``) — never written to disk,
so a stale sentinel can't outlive the condition that produced it.

Locking protocol (never holds the lock across network I/O):
(a) lock → read, decide/claim the fetch set (stamp ``lastAttemptAt``) → unlock;
(b) fetch with no lock held;
(c) lock → re-read, merge outcomes, write → unlock.
The claim stamp lets concurrent collectors skip accounts another process
started fetching moments ago; a crashed claimer just ages out.
