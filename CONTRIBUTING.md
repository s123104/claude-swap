# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this fork. Keep changes focused, tested, and aligned with upstream where possible.

## Fork relationship

This repo is a **fork of [realiti4/claude-swap](https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap)** maintained at [haotool/claude-swap](https://github.com/haotool/claude-swap). It adds auto-switch at usage limit and cross-platform background service supervision on top of upstream.

**Test policy:** the fork test suite must stay a **superset** of upstream coverage. Do not drop upstream tests when merging or syncing; add fork-specific tests alongside them.

## Versioning and PyPI

This fork uses a **PEP 440 local version** in `pyproject.toml` (e.g. `0.15.0b2+haotool.1`). The `+haotool.*` suffix is the local version label defined by [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#local-version-identifiers).

- **Single source of truth:** `[project].version` in `pyproject.toml` only. Do not duplicate the version string elsewhere.
- **Not on PyPI:** local versions are rejected by PyPI upload tooling; install this fork from git or an editable/source install (see README).
- **Upstream:** [realiti4/claude-swap](https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap) publishes semver releases to PyPI as `claude-swap` without the `+haotool.*` suffix.

When cutting a fork release, bump `[project].version` and add an entry under `[Unreleased]` / a new section in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Development setup

Requires Python 3.12+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haotool/claude-swap.git
cd claude-swap
uv sync --all-groups
```

`--all-groups` installs `[dependency-groups].dev` from `pyproject.toml` (pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy, pre-commit) per [PEP 735](https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/) and [uv dependency groups](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#development-dependencies).

Run the CLI locally:

```bash
uv run cswap --help
```

### Pre-commit

Install hooks once after syncing dev dependencies ([pre-commit docs](https://pre-commit.com/#installation)):

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

Hooks run **ruff** (lint + format) and **mypy** on commit. Ruff hook versions match CI (`v0.15.20` via `astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit`). Run manually:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Background service backends

`cswap service install|uninstall|status|logs` is a thin facade in `service.py`. Platform wiring lives under `src/claude_swap/service_backends/`:

- `select_backend()` in `service_backends/__init__.py` dispatches on `Platform.detect()` (macOS → launchd, Linux/WSL → systemd, Windows → Task Scheduler).
- Shared constants, argv/env passthrough, and user messaging live in `service_spec.py`.
- Each backend implements the `ServiceBackend` protocol in `protocols.py`.

To add or change a backend: implement the protocol in a new module, register it in `select_backend()`, and add unit tests that mock the OS service manager (see `tests/test_service.py` for launchctl, `tests/service_backends/test_systemd.py` for `systemctl`/`journalctl`, `tests/service_backends/test_task_scheduler.py` for PowerShell Task Scheduler calls). Do not touch real launchd/systemd/Task Scheduler in CI.

## Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

On macOS, Keychain contract tests run in CI; locally you can run the full suite or target a file:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_macos_keychain_contract.py -v
```

## Lint and format

Dev tools come from `uv sync --all-groups` — no separate installs needed.

```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/
```

Fix formatting with `uv run ruff format src/ tests/`. CI gates `tests/` formatting (`ruff format --check tests/`).

### Type checking (mypy)

```bash
uv run mypy
```

Configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.mypy]`. A baseline `ignore_errors` override covers modules with legacy typing debt; tighten overrides as files are cleaned up ([mypy: existing code](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/existing_code.html)).

## Pull request contract

Before opening a PR:

1. **Tests pass** — `uv run pytest`
2. **Ruff clean** — `uv run ruff check` and `uv run ruff format --check`
3. **Pre-commit** — `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` (or rely on installed hooks)
4. **Focused diff** — one logical change per PR; no drive-by refactors
5. **User-facing changes documented** — update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` (version header tracks `pyproject.toml`)
6. **Fork invariants preserved** — upstream test coverage retained; fork-only behavior covered by tests where it matters

Target branch is usually `main`. Describe what changed and how you verified it.

## Upstream sync (maintainers)

`publish/clean` is a linear history rebased on `upstream/main` with fork commits squashed into logical groups. Regenerate it with `scripts/build-clean-history.sh` (from repo root):

```bash
# default: SOURCE=improve/p1-clean-code-convergence  TARGET=publish/clean
./scripts/build-clean-history.sh [SOURCE_BRANCH] [TARGET_BRANCH]
```

What the script does:

1. `git fetch upstream`
2. Creates a dated backup branch: `backup/pre-clean-rewrite-YYYYMMDD` from `SOURCE`
3. Resets `TARGET` to `upstream/main`, squash-merges `SOURCE`, then commits files in grouped chunks (monitor, service, tests, docs, …)
4. Prints `git log upstream/main..HEAD --oneline` for review

After review, force-push the rewritten branch (e.g. `git push --force-with-lease haotool publish/clean`). Keep the backup branch until the push is verified.

Add `upstream` if missing:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap.git
```
